## Dependencies

In order to run Bonehead Bot locally, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Create a Discord account and create a new application on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Bonehead requires administrator permissions. Bonehead also needs message content and members intents.
2. Configure Python and install all required dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
3. The music bot is built with [Wavelink](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) (go give them a star on their repo), so follow the lavalink instructions laid out on their repo! The folder storing Lavalink contents should be titled `lavalink`.
4. Populate a `.env` file that contains the necessary API keys to run Bonehead. `settings.py` contains all of the correct variable names.
